# Microchallenge-II


Our own interests in mental health, wellness and physical health respectively. Understanding your body and it’s responses is what drives both of our projects and taking forward this idea, we built a first model that would help us not only collect data from our bodies but also understand and reflect on them.

Bio Sensing -HRV( Heart Rate Variability) is where the amount of time between your heartbeats fluctuates slightly. These variations are very small, adding or subtracting a fraction of a second between beats. It changes every second depending on what you’re doing, how you’re feeling.

Using HRV to read you’re body and understand it’s state and presenting it in a visual form- was the main concept for our micro challenge week.
 
We created a device that when connected to a person, reads the HRV via the ECG sensors and translates that information into different color based on the Aura color chart that highlights every color with a respective energy and being displayed on the sculpture which when seen from different angles, represents the orb shape.
